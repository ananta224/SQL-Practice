Here are 5 SQL query questions that can be solved using multiple approaches (using JOIN, SUBQUERY, CTE, WINDOW FUNCTION, EXISTS, etc.). These are great for practicing different SQL techniques.


---

1. Find employees with the highest salary in each department

❓Question:

> Given a table employees(emp_id, name, salary, dept_id), find the employee(s) with the highest salary in each department.



🧠 Approaches:

Using JOIN (Self-join)

Using CTE with RANK()/DENSE_RANK()

Using Subquery with MAX(salary)



---

2. Find duplicate rows in a table

❓Question:

> In a table students(id, name, class), find all records that have duplicate names and class combinations.



🧠 Approaches:

Using GROUP BY with HAVING count > 1

Using WINDOW function ROW_NUMBER() > 1

Using EXISTS or IN with correlated subquery



---

3. Delete duplicate rows while keeping one

❓Question:

> Given a table orders(order_id, customer_id, order_date), delete duplicate records based on customer_id and order_date, but keep the one with the lowest order_id.



🧠 Approaches:

Using CTE with ROW_NUMBER()

Using NOT IN / NOT EXISTS

Using TEMP table and DISTINCT insert



---

4. Get second highest salary

❓Question:

> From employees(emp_id, name, salary), find the second highest salary.



🧠 Approaches:

Using Subquery with LIMIT/OFFSET

Using CTE with DENSE_RANK()

Using MAX() with WHERE salary < (SELECT MAX(salary)...)



---

5. Retrieve departments with more than 3 employees

❓Question:

> Given employees(emp_id, name, dept_id), return the departments that have more than 3 employees.



🧠 Approaches:

Using GROUP BY with HAVING

Using Subquery with COUNT

Using WINDOW Function COUNT() OVER(PARTITION BY dept_id) and filtering
